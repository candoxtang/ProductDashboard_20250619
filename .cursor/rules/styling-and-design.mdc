# Styling and Design Guide

This document covers the visual styling conventions used in the dashboard.

## Formal Design Rules
A set of formal design rules is defined in [`chart-design-rules.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/chart-design-rules.mdc). This includes important rules, such as **never adding legends to trend charts**.

## Styling Implementation
Consistent visual styling is achieved through shared utilities and conventions.

### Chart Colors
A standard color palette is defined in [`js/chart-utils.js`](mdc:js/chart-utils.js) under `window.chartUtils.chartColors.main`.

To ensure products have a consistent color across all charts, use a helper function. A reference implementation can be found in [`js/org-costing.js`](mdc:js/org-costing.js) (`getProductColor`).

### Point Styles (Shapes)
To differentiate data series from different sources (e.g., Fabs), unique point styles are used on trend charts. A mapping of Fab to point style (e.g., `'Fab A': 'triangle'`) is defined in:
- [`js/org-costing.js`](mdc:js/org-costing.js)
- [`js/charts.js`](mdc:js/charts.js)

This ensures, for example, that data from Fab A always appears with a triangular marker.

### CSS
General application styles are located in [`css/style.css`](mdc:css/style.css). This includes layout, typography, and styles for UI elements like buttons and tabs.
