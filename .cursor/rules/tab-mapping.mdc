# Tab to File Mapping

Each tab in the dashboard UI is controlled by a specific JavaScript file. This file is responsible for all the logic, chart creation, and event handling within that tab.

*   **Organizational Costing Overview**: `js/org-costing.js`
*   **Manufacturing & Production**: `js/charts.js`
*   **Quality & Process**: `js/quality-dashboard.js`
*   **Material Analysis**: `js/material-analysis.js`
*   **Cost Category Analysis**: `js/cost-category-analysis.js`
*   **Actual Cost Config**: `js/cost-configuration.js`

When you need to modify a chart or functionality on a specific tab, you should start by looking at its corresponding file.
