# Startup and Data Flow

This application uses an event-driven model to manage asynchronous data initialization and prevent race conditions.

## Sequence of Events

1.  **HTML Load**: The browser loads [`index.html`](mdc:index.html), which includes all necessary JavaScript files.
2.  **DOM Ready**: The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires.
3.  **Data Generation**: An event listener in [`js/data-source.js`](mdc:js/data-source.js) triggers the `initializeDataSource` function. This function generates all the application's mock data and populates the `window.appData` object.
4.  **Data Ready Event**: Once data generation is complete, [`js/data-source.js`](mdc:js/data-source.js) dispatches a custom event named `dataReady` on the `document` object.
5.  **Chart Initialization**: All dashboard-specific scripts (e.g., [`js/charts.js`](mdc:js/charts.js), [`js/org-costing.js`](mdc:js/org-costing.js)) have an event listener that waits for the `dataReady` event.
6.  **Render**: Once the `dataReady` event is received, these scripts access the data from `window.appData` and render their respective charts.

This approach ensures that no chart rendering or data processing is attempted before all data is available, which is critical for the stability of the dashboard.
