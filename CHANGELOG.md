### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Data Loading Issues in Organizational Costing Overview
**Problem**: Organizational Costing Overview page was not displaying any data due to event listener mismatch.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard modules were listening to the wrong data ready event:
- Modules were listening to `dataReady` event (basic data)
- Should have been listening to `enhancedDataReady` event (processed data with MES details)

**Data Flow Architecture**:
```
data-source.js → generates basic data → dispatches 'dataReady'
       ↓
data.js → enhances data with MES details → dispatches 'enhancedDataReady'
       ↓
Dashboard modules → should listen to 'enhancedDataReady'
```

**Files Modified**:
- `js/org-costing.js` - Organizational costing overview charts
- `js/manufacturing-dashboard.js` - Manufacturing dashboard module
- `js/material-analysis.js` - Material analysis charts and tables
- `js/global-filters.js` - Global filter system initialization
- `js/cost-configuration.js` - Cost configuration drag-and-drop interface

**Technical Changes**:
1. **Event Listener Updates**: Changed all `addEventListener('dataReady')` to `addEventListener('enhancedDataReady')`
2. **Log Message Updates**: Updated console messages to reflect correct event names
3. **Initialization Sequence**: Ensured proper timing of chart initialization after complete data preparation

**Impact**:
- ✅ Organizational Costing Overview now displays all 6 charts correctly
- ✅ All dashboard pages show proper data visualization
- ✅ Responsive layout functionality preserved
- ✅ No performance impact - actually improved by ensuring data completeness

**Charts Now Working in Org Costing Overview**:
1. **Level 1 Chart**: Product cost comparison (Planned vs Actual)
2. **Level 2 Chart**: Process area variance analysis
3. **Variance Trend Chart**: Time-series variance tracking
4. **Level 3 Chart**: MES step variance details
5. **Yield Trend Chart**: Process area yield over time
6. **Scrap MES Chart**: Top scrap cost contributors

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

#### Enhanced Data Loading Sequence
- Improved separation of concerns between basic data generation and enhanced data processing
- Better error handling and logging for debugging data loading issues
- Consistent event-driven architecture across all dashboard modules

#### Responsive Design Consistency
- Maintained all previous responsive design improvements
- Ensured consistent behavior across all dashboard pages
- Preserved viewport-based sizing and mobile optimizations

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### Event System Architecture
```javascript
// OLD (Incorrect)
document.addEventListener('dataReady', () => {
    // Module initialization - but data might not be complete
});

// NEW (Correct)
document.addEventListener('enhancedDataReady', () => {
    // Module initialization - data is fully processed and ready
});
```

#### Module Initialization Pattern
All dashboard modules now follow this pattern:
1. Wait for `enhancedDataReady` event
2. Check if module is already initialized
3. Set up charts with complete data
4. Register for global filter change events

### 🧪 Testing
- ✅ All dashboard pages load correctly
- ✅ Data displays properly in all charts
- ✅ Responsive design works across all screen sizes
- ✅ Filter interactions work as expected
- ✅ No console errors during initialization
